# Inspections

This code was something I was going to try to develop into a website, in order to be able to access 
restaurant ratings in the state of Florida. The concept was to import the public data from the state's
FTP server, then whenever someone browsed to an inspection, it would go out to the web and scrape the data 
for each inspection detail, and display it nicely. 

However, I recently found that the state now offers a free app which already does this, so I decided to make this
open source so others might learn from it. Feel free to reuse and repurpose it however you'd like.

*I realize that the vendor folder is included, and there is no composer file in use. This was done before I learned 
how to use composer. I do not code this way now. ;o)*
